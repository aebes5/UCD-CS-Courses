The program then tells the user their gross pay, and how much of it was overtime pay(time and a half if applicable). Social Security withdrawal, Medicare, Federal tax, Colorado income tax, and the retirement are then subtracted from the gross pay. The user is then told the amount deducted, and their net pay.
