## Description of the program

This program asks the user to enter a password. If the passwords doesn't meet all of the requirements for a valid password(8-12 characters, upper case letter, lower case letter, number **not including 0, 1, 7**,  special character **{!@#$%^&*()_+}**, and not one of the user's previous 5 passwords), the user is asked to retry with information on why their password is failing. The user gets 5 attempts after their first fail until the program stops running. The user's past valid passwords are stored in a **PastPasswords.txt** file.
