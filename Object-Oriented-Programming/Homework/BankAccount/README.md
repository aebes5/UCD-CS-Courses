## Description of the program

The program asks the user for a starting amount of their Bank Account as an integer. The program then asks the user for the interest rate as a percentage. The program then generates random numbers between 480 and 620, subtracting the amount from the balance and then adding interest. Random amounts are withdrawn until the user has a balance of 0. Once the balance amount is less than 620, the program no longer generates a random number, but instead subtracts the remaining balance so the user doesn't reach a negative balance. A log is then printed out showing the number of times run, month and year of the withdrawal, balance before the withdrawal, withdrawal amount, interest added, and the new balance.
