## Description of the program

This program asks a user to enter a word, and then finds all of the subwords in the word given. The program reads through the **words_CR_LF.txt** file and prints out the number of subwords in the word. The program also creates a new text file **subwords_list.txt** which displays each of the subwords(not including the word inputted by the user).

## Source files

**Subwords.cpp**

This is the main function that does all of the functions of the program.

**words_CR_LF.txt**
